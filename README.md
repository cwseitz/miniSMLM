# miniSMLM

Minimal repository for analyzing localization microscopy images for super-resolution

## Basic installation

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS. [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/linux/) is required to create a virtual environment. All of the necessary dependencies are specified in the conda environment file ```miniSMLM.yml```. Assuming you have Anaconda already installed on your machine, run
 
``` 
conda env create -f /path/to/miniSMLM.yml
conda activate miniSMLM
```  
Then change to the root directory of miniSMLM, which contains ```setup.py```. Run 

``` 
pip install -e .
```  

This will install miniSMLM in development mode
